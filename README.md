# Mapping_Earthquakes

Creating interactive maps allow us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world. We use JS and D3 library to create an interactive world map, also we use GeoJSON which is a JSON file specifically designed to host geographical information. 

For this project, we will use the latest earthquakes GeoJSON data form the US geological survey website to traverse and retrieve GeoJSON in order to populate a geographical map.

In our map the magnitude and location of each earthquake will be shown in a popup market, the diameter of the markers for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Finally in order to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity we add fault lines on the map which represent tectonic plate.
